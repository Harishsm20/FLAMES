## Usage
To use the Flames website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Enter the names of two individuals, and the website will instantly calculate the relationship status.

## How It Works
The Flames game works by removing common letters from the names of the two individuals. The remaining letters are used to determine the result. The acronym "FLAMES" stands for Friendship, Love, Affection, Marriage, Enmity, and Sister. The letter at the position of the remaining letters modulo 6 determines the result.
